# Restaurant Reviews üçΩÔ∏è

Created a fully functional restaurant reviews app with React and Mapbox, allowing users to search for restaurants in their area using Google places API for live data and real time reviews. Users are also able to add new restaurants, and submit new full review feedback.

## To run the project:

```
yarn || npm install

yarn start || npm run start

```

**_There are `TWO` branches for this respository_**

- `Master Branch`: In this branch I use Mapbox with Foursquare API.
- `OC Branch`: In this branch I used Google Places API.
