Buit a restaurant reviews app that shows the restaurant around you, it's a full functional app so you can add new restaurants by yourself and submit a new reviews for existing ones, buit with React and it integrates with different APIs.

## To run the project:

```
yarn || npm install

yarn start || npm run start

```

### Motivation

This my project 7 on OpenClassrooms Frontend Path, so this project for educational purposes!

### Note:

To make the project work in around your current location, you need to change `long`, `lat` values "coordinates" in both `App.js` in the API call, and in `RestaurantsMap.js`, and it gonna work completelly fine with you
